# Work queue

Last updated 2026-09-30 after the P(max) Stage-1 result.

Keep only active work here. Each item needs an action and a completion check.
Use a dated brief for additional detail. Put defects in `ISSUES.md` and landed
work in `VERSION_HISTORY.md`.

## In progress

### Decide whether to delete the Stage-2 push

`docs/briefs/2026-09-30-pmax-stage1.RESULT.md`: the Stage-1 P(max) term
failed its targeted gate. Removing the push (`N`) gives dSel +0.0042
(t +0.81) and B1 +0.0015, and worsens max-zone bias from -$1.97M to -$2.34M.
The user decides. If deleted, also remove the push from the KF measurement
model and check it separately. Complete when the push is deleted in a
version or the decision to keep it is recorded.

### Grabit hyperparameter tuning — PAUSED

Paused by user decision on 2026-08-31. Keep the incumbent
`sigma = 0.02`, `sigma_left = 0.02`, `right_gate = 0.55`, and
`left_gate = 2.0` until this item is explicitly resumed.

The two censored sides are biased in opposite directions on the current frame:

| zone | n | mean error | MAE |
|---|---|---|---|
| max | 68 | **-$2.53M** | $2.68M |
| middle | 553 | -$0.68M | $3.24M |
| floor | 249 | **+$1.97M** | $1.97M |

The v5.3.2 screen found that stronger settings shrink both bound-zone biases
but lose whole-frame performance. At `sigma = sigma_left = 0.04`, same-run A1
fell from 0.826685 to 0.823787 and C1 failed. The balanced 0.025/0.025 arm had
paired dSel +0.000267 at t=0.77 and also failed C1. Resume only if a new
objective or new data can distinguish ordinary waivers from buyout re-signings.

### Re-derive the pre-registered constants

`MARGIN = 1.05` has no recorded derivation — METHODOLOGY records only "frozen
since route-mixture phase 1", and it cannot be fitted on zone MAE because the
clip makes that objective monotone in it. `TAU = 0.52`, `SIGNING_K = 20` and
`floor_gate_k = 2.0` were each set once.

- Re-derive each on the migrated frame under a stated objective, or record why
  the current value stands.
- Complete when every constant has either a derivation or a written reason to
  leave it alone.

## Needs a brief

### Separate ex-ante and ex-post Stage-2 modes

- Define separate code paths and reports; add the terms to `CONTEXT.md`.
- The observed Bird Rights offset uses outcome information and cannot enter
  headline CV. Define completion checks in the brief.

## Ready

### Publish the accuracy panel

Build the public accuracy panel from
`docs/briefs/2026-09-28-public-accuracy-views.RESULT.md`.

- Headline: share of B1 signings within $0.5M, $2M, and $8M, with cap points
  as the secondary unit. Do not publish the zero-error share or the 10-point
  tier.
- Show unmodified A1 and B1 R-squared first, with the trim curve beside them.
- List the top five forward misses by name with a one-line reason each.
- Source every number from `oof_reference.csv` through
  `scripts/public_accuracy_views.py`, never from the `export_web` refit.
- Decide the destination first: the Value Board through `export_web`, or a
  static README section.
- Complete when the panel shows the three tiers, the trim curve, and the named
  misses, and its numbers match `public_accuracy_views.csv` for the current
  champion.

### Add P(max) to the Value Board

- Display max probability and conditional value, for example
  `85% max, $46.4M if maxed`.
- Complete when the board displays it without changing model scoring.

## Recurring

- Refresh the 2027 free-agent class with the chain in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Automate team-continuity refresh as maintenance. Treat it as a model feature
  only after a new evaluation brief.
